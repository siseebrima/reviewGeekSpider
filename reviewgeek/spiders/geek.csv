Govee Flow Plus Smart Light Bars Review: Colorful Affordable Fun,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/10/cdcef72d.png,"Ambient lighting is fun, but hardly a new addition to the smart lighting world.

I also set them up behind my 65-inch OLED during testing and was happy with the substantial gorgeous ambient glow they gave off, even with my tall ceilings and despite the TV being well over the recommended maximum size. They certainly made my movie nights more immersive!"
Vizio M Series Quantum (2022) Review: The King of the Midrange,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/10/ba5f6e89.jpg,"If you’re in the market for a new TV, you probably know that the Vizio M Series has long been one of the best lineups for the money. If you’re looking for a big TV that won’t break the bank, the 70-inch M Series Quantum (model # M70Q7-J03) is probably the best TV for the buck if you don’t care about reflection handling or need the newest gaming features.",99359,Vizio M Series Quantum (2022) ,9,10,Cameron Summerson,2021-10-12T09:00:52-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/99359/vizio-m-series-quantum-2022-review-the-king-of-the-midrange/,"So, straight up: I really like the MQ7.

Whirlwind FX ATOM Keyboard Review: A Few Bright Spots,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/09/6b35ad02.jpg,"While 60% keyboards can be tough to use for newcomers, they can save a lot of space and are very popular for it.

Combine that with my issues with the RGB effects, one of the keyboard’s main selling points, and I was disappointed by the ATOM overall."
Vizio V-Series 2.1 Soundbar V21d-J8 Review: The New Baseline,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/09/b08c5016.jpg,"After buying a new TV, the first thing you should do is grab a nice pair of speakers or a soundbar. As almost anything will sound better than the television’s built-in speakers, it’s not hard to find something that works.

Even at high volume levels, the dialog is easy to understand, and the background audio doesn’t get distorted. I wish there was more bass, but the built-in subs are fine for casual watching."

HyperX SoloCast Review: A Tiny Mic with Tiny Problems,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/09/b81a469a.jpg,"HyperX has released a couple of microphones over the years, both squarely aimed at gamers.

It’s a compact microphone that delivers hardware and audio quality befitting of the price and not much else. Minor issues like the somewhat finicky mute button are pretty easy to ignore here, and this is a great affordable alternative to more expensive compact microphones."
Ray-Ban Stories Review: Get These Off My Face,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/10/3f218d19.jpg,"The Ray-Ban Stories, or “Facebook Glasses,” as many people will come to know them, are an interesting product: a pair of glasses that can play audio, take pictures, and shoot videos.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic Review: Almost the First Great Wear OS Watch,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/09/c087f475.jpg,"If we’re honest, Android has never had a great smartwatch option to rival the Apple Watch.

Ultimate Ears HyperBoom Review: Boom Is an Understatement,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/09/56cd4327.jpg,"A little Bluetooth speaker is a quick way to bring some music to the party, but they can be lacking volume and bass due to their size.

And boy, does it succeed.",96271,Ultimate Ears HyperBoom ,8,10,Josh Hendrickson,2021-09-24T11:23:00-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/96271/ultimate-ears-hyperboom-review-boom-is-an-understatement/,"But here, we have to address the elephant in the room. The HyperBoom costs $399.99. Or, you know, more than the entry-level iPad. Let’s be frank, that’s pretty expensive for a Bluetooth speaker. And that fact that it’s JUST Bluetooth with no Wi-Fi option adds to the pain of that price."
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 Review: The Foldable Has Ascended,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/09/6f991680-1.jpg,"The original Samsung Galaxy Z Flip was an interesting phone, as it was a throwback to the flip phones that many of us grew up with. But it was a first-generation product and suffered from first-generation issues as a result. The Z Flip 3 (they skipped 2) fixes a lot of that, and it’s a great look at the current-future of smartphones.",97929,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 ,8,10,Cameron Summerson,2021-09-23T11:23:00-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/97929/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-the-foldable-has-ascended/,"Overall, these cameras are okay at best, and pretty bad at worst.

It looked nicer, the included case was better, the performance was a little bit snappier, and the cameras were just a little bit more impressive. The G91 Pro feels like a new phone for the sake of a new phone for the most part. I would’ve personally rather seen BLU put more effort into updating the G90 Pro with Android 11, but I get it. Software updates aren’t profitable, and at this price point, well, margins matter."

It’s gorgeous, versatile, expandable, and pricey.",93156,Sonos ARC ,8.5,10,Peter Cao,2021-08-12T14:00:42-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/93156/sonos-arc-review-a-flexible-upgradeable-soundbar-with-captivating-sound/,"Overall, I’m extremely happy with the Sonos ARC + single subwoofer setup. It’s definitely a “high-end” soundbar, especially if you factor in the cost of the subwoofer. But it offers such a unique and captivating experience. I have no desire to pick up anything beyond the subwoofer in the near-term future. And with Sonos’ history with its other hardware, I’m confident the ARC will continue to push firmware updates and add new features for years to come."

It looks so different and costs so much. What if it turns out to be a waste of money? If that’s you, and you’ve wanted to make the switch but are unwilling to take the risk, the Cherry Ergo keyboard is the one you should look at. It’s not overpriced, and it’s not as drastically different from the keyboard you know and love."

I used them while listening to music, video editing, watching shows, and even playing games and they performed excellently in every situation. The neutral sound profile means that these don’t excel at anything, but they’re also at least decent at everything. I’m not super picky about audio quality, so having an “all-rounder” pair like these is definitely my preference over something more specialized."

I mostly used it by my desk with the light angled toward my work surface. During the day, I keep it at full brightness, but as day turns to evening and then into night, rolling the brightness back for normal work tasks creating an excellent atmosphere for focus and concentration. I also use my desk for other things—like restringing guitars—and I never found the max brightness to be too little."

If you want to use FlexClip with mounts on your desk or in your car, you’ll need to apply it to a mount that you already have: There’s no FlexClip AC vent mount or dashboard adapter.

And adding a large display, large keyboard, and mouse to a Chromebook will cost the same as adding them to the Chromebox 4.

ThinkPad X1 Nano Review: Just Call It the “ThinkPad Air”,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2021/02/441b9ae3.jpg,"Lenovo’s ThinkPad series of laptops is associated with utilitarian design and focused capability. It’s strange, then, to see a machine like the X1 Nano: a super-light, super-sleek laptop that has more in common with the MacBook Air than any Windows-powered notebook. That contradiction means that it has a limited appeal, but not that it’s a bad machine.",71509,ThinkPad X1 Nano ,6,10,Michael Crider,2021-02-25T08:00:16-05:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/71509/thinkpad-x1-nano-review-just-call-it-the-thinkpad-air/,"I loved using the ThinkPad X1 Nano as a writing machine. Its feather weight and comfy ergonomics make it unbelievably easy to bring along and bust out for a session of work. The ThinkPad keyboard, even in this ultra-thin form, is good, and I dig the 3:2 screen. If I could shove some cheap Chromebook hardware in this body, I’d be in heaven."

You can get better earbuds, like the Jabra Elite 85t, for just a little bit more money, which is what I’d recommend doing. If you’re already spending $200, you might as well spend $230 and get the best out there."

So at that point, all that matters is the build quality, alongside any little bonus features the manufacturer can sneak in. And on that front, I’d say the XP5-X hit the nail on the head.

But sure enough, they make my aim more accurate, and I have more precision over characters, cars, or whatever I’m controlling. On top of that, the amount of grip compared to the stock joysticks is insane. Even just the simple nubbles on my Ultra thumbsticks help a ton."

It’s convenient to know when the door is open or closed, and if someone forgets to close it. I’d like to have some camera integration, so I can see things from one app as well, but for now, I’m using a Wyze Cam. And while I was testing, the internet in my home had an outage. A lot of my Wi-Fi-powered smart home devices didn’t work right without the internet, but the Nexx controller did. Because it uses Bluetooth as a fallback. That’s a fantastic win for Nexx."

And more importantly (as a LEGO collector anyway), this set comes with multiple unique bricks we haven’t seen before. In some cases, that means unusual shapes, like a hot dog with bun, that we either haven’t seen anywhere else or that can only be found in discontinued sets. In other cases, it’s architectural pieces in new colors we’ve never seen before."

If you’re comfortable with modding arcade machines, you should take a look, too—it’s rare to find a machine with spots for four joysticks. Even if you replace the controls, at least the holes are pre-drilled. You might decide you don’t have to, as Arcade1Up used better hardware on this than on its earlier machines."

By default, both buttons (left and right) pause the music with a single tap, bring up Google Assistant with a double-tap, and power off with a long-press. You can tweak this to your liking, however, as the app offers a bunch of different (and intuitive) options. For example, you can have a double-tap move forward or back one track (depending on which bud you double-tap), have a long-press control the volume, and more. It also features some “custom” options, but all of those rely on playing specific playlists from the Jaybird app, which is probably less useful."

But to put it bluntly, there are plenty of tough, nice-looking bags that aren’t this heavy, and won’t weigh you down on long treks or in sticky weather. Combined with its maximum carrying capacity, one of the bag’s biggest draws is at odds with its material."

The scents are similar, and the oil blends are the same, so they compliment each other nicely. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new line of men’s care stuff to check out, I highly recommend this new line— as the headline says, it’s some of the best stuff I’ve ever used. There are several more products available in this line that I didn’t get a chance to try, but if they’re anything like the products highlighted here, I suspect they’re equally as impressive."
Kensington SD2000P Review: Disappointing Performance Sinks This USB-C Dock,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2019/06/7db1c4f8.jpg,"Using a single cable to plug in nearly unlimited accessories has been the dream of laptop users for a long time.

The two USB 3.1 Type A ports performed within expected parameters, ditto for the gigabit Ethernet port. But the second USB-C port on the dock, despite handling data fine, can only output a maximum of five watts—that’s compared to 60 watts for the primary USB-C connection. With an adapter that has over 100 watts of juice available, I would have expected the secondary USB-C cable to be able to fast charge phones and tablets at the very least. No dice."

Mid-range tones are clear, and on many tracks there’s a noticeable sense of presence. That is also reflected when I use the headset to listen to the television. Voices are much more discernible than when the TV is playing through speakers, and background noises, like phones ringing in the background, come through when wearing the headset but not when listening through the TV’s speakers. And the Voyager 8200s are comfortable enough to wear for hours. I haven’t gone on a trip with them, but It’s not unusual for me to wear them for three or four hours at a time. The Voyager 8200s have a sensor in the earcups that pauses music or audio playback when you take the headset off, which is nice feature if you’re interrupted while using them."

But Our philosophy is to review a product as it is, not as it might be…and even with more style options, they won’t disguise the fundamental cheapness of the device. Compared to the original Steel or its more utilitarian upgrades, the Move doesn’t really compare at all.

It doesn’t have much in the way of a real indicator, but instead just blinks a tiny light on the power button when you press the Fn and Ctrl keys at the same time. If it flashes green three times, the battery is more than half full. Two yellow blinks mean it’s somewhere between 25-49%, and one red blink means it’s below 25%.

That’s simply assuming you’ve left the app at a preset EQ rather than dabbling yourself. There’s not much of a need to tweak unless you’re super keen to see what the difference is.

And it doesn’t end with the PC: between quality inputs, a decent set of speakers, and a monitor that does the graphics of your new desktop justice, you might be looking at half again as much as you paid for those high-end components.",7368,Samsung CHG70 Gaming Monitor: A Gigantic Upgrade At A Reasonable Price,8,10,Michael Crider,2018-09-18T08:00:22-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/7368/samsung-chg70-gaming-monitor-a-gigantic-upgrade-at-a-reasonable-price/,"All in all, I’m fairly pleased with the Samsung CHG70 at the $400 price I paid for it. While I wish the panel itself was thinner, especially with its bulky VESA mount, the super-low input lag has markedly improved my PC gaming sessions. The fast refresh rate and HDR aren’t quite the game-changers Samsung would like you to think they are, but they’re nice additional features nonetheless."
"Anova Precision Cooker Review: Sous Vide Is So Easy, It Almost Feels Like Cheating",https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/09/270bf543.jpg,The Anova Precision Cooker is the perfect sous vide device for anyone who’s not quite sure what sous vide is but is ready to revolutionize their cooking methods.,7983,Anova Precision Cooker ,9,10,Eric Ravenscraft,2018-10-16T08:00:40-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/7983/anova-precision-cooker-review-sous-vide-is-so-easy-it-almost-feels-like-cheating/,"In addition to chicken I’ve also tried steaks in my sous vide, but I’ll be frank, I don’t care for these quite as much, though it’s largely due to preference. Cooking steak on a pan or grill puts a high amount of heat on the outside of the steak while it cooks through to the inside. This results in a searing, crisper texture on the outside of a steak (especially the closer to well-done you like your steak cooked). In a sous vide cooking, this doesn’t happen. Now, you "
Harry Potter Kano Coding Kit Review: A Magical Experience,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/10/59757e61.jpg,"Toys and games that are super fun for your kids but also surprisingly educational are the sweet spot for many parents’ purchasing needs.

You get to enjoy those little moments of waving a wand around and “casting” a spell, tossing a Harry Potter themed item up into the air or simply setting off fireworks on screen. Plus, there’s the fact that your kids (and you) are learning along the way."
eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Review: A Practical (If Not Particularly Intelligent) Robotic Vacuum,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/08/95ad0284.jpg,Vacuuming isn’t the most thrilling domestic task which is why robot vacuums are so appealing. But can you get by without a top-of-the-line model? We took the eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S for a (literal) spin to see if a reasonable priced option can compete.,6033,eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S ,7,10,Jennifer Allen,2018-08-30T11:00:45-04:00,https://www.reviewgeek.com/6033/eufy-boostiq-robovac-11s-review-a-practical-if-not-particularly-intelligent-robotic-vacuum/,"How much you like eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S is really going to be down to how hands-on you want to be. Without that all important smartphone functionality, you won’t be able to get eufy to do stuff while you’re out running errands, nor will you be able to lie in bed treating him like a remote control car. The range on the remote isn’t that great."
"Anker Soundcore Flare Review: Stylish, Rugged, and Customizable",https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/06/d6d7655a.jpg,"Bluetooth speakers are a pretty great concept but you have to pay a lot for the best sound experience, right?

All dark colored devices, naturally, show more dust than light colored ones but the textured rubber on the top of the Flare, in particular, was an incredible dust magnet. In a very short space of time, I found it pretty dusty in no time at all, as you can see in the photos. It’s never as clean as it is the moment you take it out of the box."

But if you’re still using an Android phone from last year (and especially one that has cameras that are still brilliant), there’s very little here that compels an upgrade."
Google Titan Security Key Review: Two Great Keys For The Price Of One,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/08/2bbd33ad.jpg,Google’s getting into the two-factor security key game with their freshly released Titan Security Key Bundle.

It’d be nice if lasted a year or longer in some sort of ultra-low-energy state, but that’s a minor complaint."
Lenovo Smart Display Review: Google Home Gets a Much Needed (But Expensive) Upgrade,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/07/5a567e9d.jpg,"Lenovo has introduced the first of the Google Assistant-enabled smart displays.

That’s a pretty huge price premium to put on top of existing smart speakers and, if we’re honest, you can probably do 80% of what a smart display can do with your voice. The screen is by no means necessary, and in fact Google has spent years making sure you can use its voice assistant "
Anker Soundcore Space NC Headphones Review: An Ideal Budget Pick,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/08/79c1d909.jpg,"Premium noise cancelling headphones are pretty expensive, but the Anker Soundcore Space NC sets out to prove they don’t have to be.

There’s just the right level of oomph here, so that you feel suitably enthralled by what you’re listening to. Similarly, the highs do a decent job of capturing smooth vocals and the finer details of certain musical tracks. My testing methods involve things like Foo Fighters to check how loud and bassy music sounds, before switching up to the softer, less processed tones of a friend’s album. In both cases, there was minimal distortion and I felt suitably wrapped up in the music."
Foobot Air Quality Monitor Review: Dial In Your Air Quality With A Friendly Assistant,https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/08/1beafbc9.jpg,You might not pay much attention to the air quality in your home.

Because he starts out as a simple remote control toy, he’s ideal with a young child who simply wants to play with something a bit better than regular wheeled toy. Soon enough though, your child will want to delve further and see what else they can do with him. If they’re struggling to figure things out, you can generally piece it together yourself or you can consult Makeblock’s numerous learning guides or examples."
"The Kindle Oasis: Two Years Later, Still The Best E-Reader Around",https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2018/07/daf3eeae.jpg,The Kindle Oasis is Amazon’s premium Kindle device. It’s—supposedly—the best e-reader Amazon can make but is it worth the ridiculous price?

It’s the best Kindle yet and an incredible device, but it isn’t without a few flaws. The main one is that, well, it’s kind of big. I was able to squeeze my Kindle Paperwhite into the pocket of most of my jackets; that just isn’t possible with the Oasis. While the extra size is nice when you’re reading, it makes it a little bit harder to take your Kindle everywhere. If you always carry a bag, you probably won’t notice, but if you’re used to heading out with your Kindle in your pocket, it is going to annoy you."

But the Fire TV Cube is way easier to set up than the Harmony Hub, and it’s the same price you’d pay for a Harmony Hub/Echo Dot combo, which makes it a great buy for anyone not wanting to hassle with a complicated setup."
